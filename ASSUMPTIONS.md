# URL Hashing System Assumptions

This document outlines the assumptions made for the URL Hashing System. These assumptions help provide context and understanding for the system's design and functionality. Please note the following assumptions:

1. **High Traffic System**: The URL Hashing System is designed to handle high traffic, with a large number of requests processed concurrently. The system architecture and infrastructure are optimized for scalability and performance.

2. **Short URL Generation**: Generating short URLs does not need to happen instantly. The system follows a workflow where all necessary verifications and checks are performed on the provided URL before a short URL is generated. The focus is on ensuring the validity and safety of the URLs rather than instant generation.

3. **Valid and Well-Formed URLs**: It is assumed that all input URLs provided to the system are valid and well-formed. This means that the URLs are correctly structured and conform to the expected format (e.g., protocol, domain, path).

These assumptions help shape the design and functionality of the URL Hashing System, taking into account considerations such as system performance, URL verification, and input validity.
